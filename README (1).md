# **imoji Browser Extension 🚀**

**imoji** is a revolutionary, keyboard-first browser extension designed to supercharge your workflow. It instantly replaces emoji shortcodes (like :heart:) with their corresponding emojis ❤️ and integrates a powerful AI assistant directly into your browser.

This tool is built for users who value speed and efficiency, allowing you to find emojis and get answers without ever leaving your text box or switching tabs.

## **✨ Core Features**

* **Instant Emoji Shortcodes:** Simply type a shortcode like :lol: or :rocket: and press the spacebar to have it instantly replaced with the correct emoji (😂 or 🚀).  
* **Custom Emoji Manager:** Add your own personal shortcodes\! The settings page allows you to map any shortcode you want (e.g., :brb:) to any emoji (e.g., 💨).  
* **Built-in AI Assistant:** Get answers and information on the fly without opening a new tab.  
* **AI Right-Click Menu:** The recommended way to use the AI. Simply highlight any text on any webpage, right-click, and select "Ask Imoji about..." to get an instant explanation or more information.  
* **AI Text Command:** For power users, type :ai followed by your question (e.g., :ai what is the capital of Japan) and press spacebar twice to get an answer.
